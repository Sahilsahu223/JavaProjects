Welcome to my Java Revision Hub! This repository is my personal space for consolidating, practicing, and reinforcing my understanding of the Java programming language, from its core fundamentals to more advanced topics.

Each project here is a practical exercise designed to solidify specific concepts. This repository serves as my active, hands-on notebook.

## My Revision Strategy

To make the most of this repository, I follow a few key strategies:

* **Re-implementation**: Periodically re-implementing projects from scratch without looking at the existing solution to test my recall and problem-solving skills.
* **Feature Enhancement**: Adding new features to existing projects to explore concepts more deeply.
* **Code Refactoring**: Revisiting completed projects to improve code quality, readability, and efficiency.
* **Concept Notes**: Using each project's internal `README.md` to jot down detailed notes, "gotchas," and key takeaways about the concepts involved.

## Projects & Concepts Under Revision

The projects are categorized by the primary concepts they are designed to reinforce.

### ‚òï Revisiting Core Java

These projects focus on the fundamental building blocks of the Java language.

* **[Simple Calculator](./SimpleCalculator/)**
    * **Focus**: Solidifying foundational syntax and logic flow.
    * **Concepts Revised**: `Methods`, `Scanner` for user input, `switch` statements, and basic error handling.

* **[To-Do List Application](./TodoListApp/)**

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run a Project

The steps to run a project may vary, but for the basic console applications, the process is as follows:

1.  **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd <ProjectName>
    ```
2.  **Compile the Java source file(s)**:
    ```sh
    javac *.java
    ```
3.  **Run the compiled application**:
    ```sh
    java <MainClassName>
    ```

**Note**: For specific details, always check the `README.md` inside each project's folder.

## üí¨ Feedback & Suggestions
While this is a personal revision repository, any suggestions or feedback for improvement are always welcome! If you spot a bug or a better way to implement something, feel free to open an issue.
