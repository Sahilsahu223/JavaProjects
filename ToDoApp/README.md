# Console To-Do List Application

![Built with Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20with-Java-orange.svg)

A simple, yet powerful, console-based To-Do List application built with Java. This project is designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts, including managing collections of data (`ArrayList`) and performing file I/O for data persistence.

The application allows users to manage a list of tasks directly from the command line and ensures that no data is lost between sessions by automatically saving the list to a local file.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **Full CRUD Functionality**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete tasks.
* **Data Persistence**: The application automatically saves your task list to a `tasks.txt` file when you exit.
* **Automatic Loading**: When you start the application, it automatically reloads all tasks from `tasks.txt` so you can pick up where you left off.
* **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive commands for easy task management.
* **Lightweight**: No external dependencies are required beyond the standard Java Development Kit (JDK).

## ðŸ’» Technology Stack

* **Language**: Java
* **Core Libraries**: Java Collections Framework, Java I/O (`java.io`)
